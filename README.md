===========

Welcome!

## Labs
Your project consists of four labs. You are *strongly advised* to start early.  

* [Lab 1](lab1.md): due **March 6, 2026 11:59pm (week 6)**.
* [Lab 2](lab2.md): due **March 20, 2026 11:59pm (week 8)**.
* [Lab 3](lab3.md): due **April 3, 2026 11:59pm (week 11)**. 
* [Lab 4](lab4.md): due **April 24, 2026 11:59pm (week 13)**. 

Each lab is given **10 points**: **8** for passing all the tests, and **2** for the report. 

## Important
In addition to the academic integrity policy (as discussed in the lecture), take note that: 
* You cannot make your Github repository for the labs public. 
* You cannot copy and paste code from other people or any other sources. 
* You cannot share your solutions.  


### Acknowledgement
